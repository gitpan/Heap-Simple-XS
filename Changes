Revision history for Perl extension Heap::Simple::XS.

Plan:
	- dirty strings
        - add tests for self-locking

0.05  2004-11-07
	- Removed a few unused variables.
        - Add a few returns at unreachable places after croak to shut up 
          compilers that think not all control paths return a value.
	- Call pp_xxx through the ppaddr table so we don't need to link them.

0.04  2004-11-06
	- A few declaration were in the middle of code which is an error
          on strict C compilers.
	- Try to define infinity in a more portable way
        - Added a basic "load the module directly" test since the indirection
          through Heap::Simple hides load errors.
        - Remove "use warnings" everywhere to give people a fighting chance to 
          get the module working on perls before 5.6

0.03  2004-11-05
	- self-lock during DESTROY too
	- Added a few forgotten aTHX_ arguments to key_insert (reported by 
          Mike Castle, thanks).
	- dropped useless load of Carp in XS.pm

0.02  2004-10-26
	- Document that dirty Array and Hash types for numeric orders will
          be effectively wrapped.
	- Document the use of dirty NV keys for types Any and Object.
        - Didn't properly free stuff already allocated if new croaks (bugfix)

0.01  2004-10-25
        - First Releasable version.

0.00  2004-10-12
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-n Heap::Simple::XS
